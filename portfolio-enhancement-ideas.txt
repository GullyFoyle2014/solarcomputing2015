// Portfolio

- Do "CSS Masonry", with each item, being a portfolio entry with image and text description.
- a expand/details button on each, will create a modal with a bigger image and more text.
- on the modal, a "next" will load the next item as modal, or users can click "X" and go back to Masonry page display.

make it responsive along these lines:http://w3bits.com/css-masonry/
